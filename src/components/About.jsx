        <p>
          Hi, I'm <strong>Sandeep Paswan</strong>, a passionate developer with expertise in Shopify 
          development, WordPress, and a wide array of web technologies. I specialize in building
           robust and scalable e-commerce solutions, particularly on the Shopify platform, and also 
           create dynamic, customizable websites using WordPress.
        </p>
        <p>
          With years of experience in building custom Shopify themes, integrating apps, and optimizing
           store performance, I have a deep understanding of how to create user-friendly, visually 
           appealing, and high-converting online stores. On the WordPress side, I build custom 
           themes, plugins, and optimize sites for performance and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to Shopify and WordPress, I'm skilled in <strong>React.js</strong> for building 
          dynamic, single-page applications, and proficient in backend technologies like
           <strong>Node.js</strong> to handle API integrations and server-side logic. I also have 
           experience working with <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>,
            and <strong>CSS</strong> to build fully responsive, interactive websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're looking to develop a custom Shopify store, a WordPress site, integrate advanced
           features, or create a complete web application, I have the expertise to deliver a seamless and
           effective solution.
